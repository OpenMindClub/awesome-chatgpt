- [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/): **Language Model for Dialogue Applications** is a family of conversational large language models developed by Google. LaMDA uses a decoder-only transformer language model.
- [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama): by Meta AI, A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model. LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a state-of-the-art foundational large language model designed to help researchers advance their work in this subfield of AI.
- [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446) - by DeepMind, a 280 billion parameter transformer language model called Gopher, is an autoregressive transformer-based dense LLM.
- [GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B) - GLM is a General Language Model developed by Tsinghua University. GLM-130B is an open bilingual (English&Chinese) version of GLM with 130 billion parameters, designed for users with a single A100 or V100 server23.
- [GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/GPT-NeoXT-Chat-Base-20B) - An open-source language model that can chat and generate images. Created by EleutherAI.
- [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) - by BigScience, BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.
- [OPT]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01068)) - by Meta, The OPT model was proposed in Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models by Meta AI. OPT is a series of open-sourced large causal language models which perform similar in performance to GPT3.

### The technical principle of ChatGPT

- 2014 [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) - This paper introduces an attention mechanism in RNNs to improve the long sequence modelling of RNNs. This paper introduces an attention mechanism to RNNs to improve their long sequence modelling capabilities. This enables RNNs to translate longer sentences more accurately.
- 2017 [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - This paper introduces the structure of the original Transformer and is the basis for the Transformer family.
- 2018 [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) - This paper ushered in the era of pre-training in NLP. BERT came out of nowhere.
- 2018 [Improving language understanding by generative pre-training](https://openai.com/research/language-unsupervised) - This paper introduces another popular pre-training model, also known to later generations as GPT-1.
- 2019 [Language models are unsupervised multitask learners](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Language-Models-are-Unsupervised-Multitask-Learners-Radford-Wu/9405cc0d6169988371b2755e573cc28650d14dfe) - This paper introduces GPT-2.
- 2020 [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) - This paper introduces GPT-3.
- 2022 [Training lanquage models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) - This paper presents an RLHF approach to using supervised learning to fine-tuning. It is also known as a paper that illustrates the kernel of ChatGPT's thinking. Presumably, ChatGPT is an extended version of InstructGPT that enables fine-tuning on larger datasets.
- 2023 [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs.

### Social impact

- 2023 [GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130)  Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure.
